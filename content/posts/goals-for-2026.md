## Introduction

2024 was a big year in terms of growth for me. I spent a lot of time getting
out of my comfort zone and saying yes to everything I could. I had a lot of new
experiences and learnt a lot about myself as a person.

2025 built on that but didn't push the boundary quite so much. Life was really
good and I felt much more comfortable in my own skin, but it's hard to point to
quite as many new experiences.

I've never been one for goal setting, but perhaps now is a good time to change
that and at least begin to experiment with it. I need to remind myself that
being stationary won't end well, so setting some direction and measurable goals
feels sensible.

Each section will outline an area of my life, where I find myself currently and
areas where I could push myself in the upcoming year. Some goals will be highly
measurable, others will be based more on feel. I'll start by reviewing them
every month to allow myself to course correct frequently, but this may reduce
over the span of the year.
