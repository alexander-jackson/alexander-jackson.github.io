## Introduction

2024 was a big year in terms of growth for me. I spent a lot of time getting
out of my comfort zone and saying yes to everything I could. I had a lot of new
experiences and learnt a lot about myself as a person.

2025 built on that but didn't push the boundary quite so much. Life was really
good and I felt much more comfortable in my own skin, but it's hard to point to
quite as many new experiences.

I've never been one for goal setting, but perhaps now is a good time to change
that and at least begin to experiment with it. I need to remind myself that
being stationary won't end well, so setting some direction and measurable goals
feels sensible.

Each section will outline an area of my life, where I find myself currently and
areas where I could push myself in the upcoming year. Some goals will be highly
measurable, others will be based more on feel. I'll start by reviewing them
every month to allow myself to course correct frequently, but this may reduce
over the span of the year.

## Professional Growth

Where most sections list the success in 2024 compared to a solidification in
2025, the opposite is probably true for this area. The former was a very
relaxed year professionally, which saw me focus on other areas of my life for
the time being. The latter, after the move to Monument, saw this become much
more of a focus.

I come into 2026 leading a team of 5 engineers and trying to understand what I
need to do in order to improve them. This is going to involve a lot of soft
skills, through chatting to each of them about their progression and generally
acting as a barrier so they can get their work done.

Each of them are going to require different things from me in different
measures. The requirements of managing someone like Victor are going to be
vastly different to someone like Debbie. April and Joe present their own
challenges as well, with the aim to push them towards the higher software
engineering levels.

Success and progression in this area will likely be measured through the
success and progression of the engineers I am leading. There's certainly scope
for improving my own abilities technically, and this will form part of my goals
discussion with Martin, but these will be more difficult than expanding my
managerial skills.

## Creative Output

I've always loved good quality technical writing, where the author either
reduces a complex topic down to the very basics or dives unreasonably deep into
something you felt like you already knew well.

As part of this, I've done some technical writing of my own over the past
couple of years. Lots of this has been internal to my professional life where I
have written long-form blog posts about how we do things at Starling or
problems we have run into, but I've also started writing more adhoc outside of
work (although still in a technical capacity).

Writing for my own blog gives me a little bit more freedom in terms of what I
talk about and the style of communication, as well as feeling like there's a
lower bar for entry as it won't be used to assess me professionally quite so
much. Announcing a blog post to hundreds of engineers I work with feels like
being in the spotlight more.

As part of this area, I'd like to commit to writing at least one blog post per
month. This will stretch me both in terms of writing skills as well as
organisation as some months may be quite busy and I'd still like to hit that
target. I'll need to run ahead a little in terms of topics, just so I don't get
to the end of a month and have no idea what to write about.

## Health & Fitness

This area has certainly taken more focus over the course of 2025 than 2024 with
all the training for Hackney Half and the renewed focus on my strength
training. Although the former has faded away and I'm not doing quite so much
running, it was a nice reminder that I could if it felt like the right
direction.

### Training

I've really enjoyed tracking all my training sessions for the past couple of
months as it has allowed me to push individual exercises and force myself to
progress. I do feel like I am noticing physical differences in my body from the
focused effort, so that's going to need to continue.

In this area, I might want to put some time into improving `opentracker.app` so
I can use the data I'm inputting to provide more insights to my progression.

### Swimming

Within the next couple days of writing this, my membership at Third Space will
start and I'll have much easier access to a swimming pool. I've got a pair of
goggles and some earplugs, so the intention is to improve my swimming ability
and work towards the half Ironman swimming distance of 1.9km in a single go. I
have no idea how hard this will be, I obviously have the strength and physical
endurance to do it but will need to figure out the technique. This will
probably mark the start of some very busy weeks as I attempt to fit all the
training in, but I actually quite enjoyed that with Hackney at times.

### General Care

Over the last couple of years, I've started putting a lot more thought into my
general upkeep as a person. This has included improved personal grooming and
changing the way I dress, but there's not too much more to be done with regards
to those outside of incremental improvements.

As part of this, I've started having more frequent dentist appointments and
focusing on my dental hygiene. These have generally come back very well, so
I've started considering getting my teeth whitened with the knowledge that it
would last a long time given the care I take. I'm also tempted by Invisalign to
sort out the remaining unevenness in my teeth and get some new retainers for
afterwards.

On top of this, I've started considering getting private treatment for the
psoriasis on my arms. I'm not sure how much this would cost or how much effort
it would take, but it might be worth gambling on it.

I've also considered getting laser eye surgery to correct my vision, but that
seems like it has a poor cost to benefit ratio given that I don't have any real
problems with contact lenses and Lasik can cost ~£7000.

## Relationships & Social Life

Where 2024 built a lot of new friendships that I have carried over, 2025
largely worked on solidifying them. People like Rob, Lucie and Caitlin have
become some of my closest friends and my social life is much more vibrant than
it used to be (I have to maintain a calendar now, which is a nice downside).

### Platonic

With Rob and I fully moved into the flat now, I'm keen to host more events at
ours as time goes on. We've got a big space to work with and I'd like to have
excuses to see my friends more regularly. Hosting is a social good, it brings
together people who have a good chance of connecting with each other and gets
people chatting.

The focus here will be around expanding my group and deepening my existing
friendships. I don't meet new people as much as I like, perhaps a goal can be
to talk to a person I don't consider my friend currently at every gathering I
go to.

### Romantic

The elephant in the room. At some point I should probably write an entire post
about this just to really see how I feel, but the crux of the matter is that I
have been single for almost 2 years now and it's probably time to get back out
there.

I've made a huge amount of change to myself and really began to understand who
I am, how I operate and what I want in life. I'm much more confident in myself
than I was before and relatively certain that I have what it takes to be a
great partner. I've spent a lot of time in the last 2 years talking to others
about their relationships and understanding the way people work. I have no
intention of being single for the rest of my life, so there's no time like the
present to begin avoiding that outcome.

In terms of goals here, there's nothing particularly concrete. I don't know how
much time I will spend dating, but I want to get to the end of the year and
feel like I had a good crack at it. I might not find the partner I spend the
rest of my life with, but I want to take some risks, get out of my comfort
zone and have some fun while doing it.

## Financial Literacy & Growth

Financially speaking, I'm doing well for my age. I've got a well paying job
that provides me with a consistent income and I have the ability to save a lot
of money each month regardless of the rent that I am currently paying. My money
is relatively well diversified, with some of it in regular savings accounts,
other bits in various ISA accounts and small amounts in my regular balance.

I've got enough money to think about making some big purchases without too much
hesitation such as my watch and Invisalign, and it's not usually a concern for
me which is good in terms of stability.

That being said, I always wonder whether I could be doing more with it. At my
age there's definitely the opportunity to take more risks and potentially have
a higher reward, so perhaps this should be something I look at in 2026. Getting
a book on financial literacy might be a good starting point that I can build on
over time.

## Hobbies & Exploration

- Getting outside your comfort zone
- New experiences you want to try
- Interests to pursue or develop
- Saying yes to opportunities
- Balance between structured and spontaneous activities

Much like some of the other sections, 2024 was a little bit of a breakthrough
year for me in terms of this component and 2025 built on what that had
provided. I did a couple of solo travelling trips through Europe, camped for
the first time since I went to Tanzania and said yes to anything I possibly
could.

2025 focused more on travelling with friends and settling into the hobbies I
found the most joy in. I went to new countries (Morocco and Portgual), went
back to others I had enjoyed before (Italy, France and Slovenia) and generally
had a blast with some of my closest friends. The highlights include:

* Lisbon and Porto with Krish, Jiano and Mohit
* French roadtrip with Rob
* Lake Bled in Slovenia with Caitlin and James

### New Activities

There are a couple of things I'd like to try and find the time for this year,
that I didn't get a chance to do in previous ones.

The first of these is paragliding. I wanted to do this when I travelled through
Austria in the summer of 2024, but the weather wasn't good enough and Zell Am
See was too inconvenient to make it to. As much as I'm scared of heights, I
love the idea of getting a bird's eye view of a beautiful landscape and it will
push me out of my comfort zone.

### New Environments

Since 2025 focused more on holidays with my friends, it didn't leave quite as
much scope for new countries or areas to be explored. 2026 feels like a good
time to make this a more focused effort.

I've always said that I wanted to travel to South America or Asia with a
partner and I feel like that still holds true. If I don't meet the right person
within the first half of 2026, it's unlikely that this will be achievable this
year. There's still room for a solo trip but that depends more on my appetite
for that sort of thing.

With continent expansion potentially off the table, it's worth considering the
parts of Europe I'm yet to visit. I'd really like to drive around Iceland and
Norway, so perhaps this necessitates another goal of finally learning how to
drive.

There's also the option of exploring Eastern Europe more. My first interrailing
trip concluded in Budapest where I could have headed down towards Serbia,
Bosnia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Albania. Transport links wouldn't be as
good in those areas, but it would be cool to continue where I left off and head
down to Athens or something.

## Home & Environment

When we moved into the flat in Clapham, we signed a 2 year contract and thus
avoided making some improvements that would have been worthwhile in the long
run given we stayed there for 4 years in the end.

While I'm not sure how long we will be in Monument, it's worth not repeating
the mistakes of the past. There are plenty of things I can pick up (and already
have) that will be transferable to a new place of residence and I still have at
least 8 months left there.

Most of this is incremental and very fuzzy in terms of goal setting. Each
month, I should try and remind myself to make at least one improvement to the
flat. Over time this will compound, and by the time we leave I'll have
accumulated plenty of useful posessions.
