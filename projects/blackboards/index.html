It handles registration for club sessions, displaying member personal bests and running the annual position elections.\nSource: https://github.com/alexander-jackson/blackboards/\nOverview Each year, Warwick Barbell runs taster sessions that allow newer lifters to try out powerlifting and weightlifting while being coached by existing members. Due to the ongoing pandemic, we needed to ensure that attendance at these sessions was both recorded for contact tracing and capped for social distancing. While this could be achieved through approaches such as Google Forms or other services, I took the opportunity to work on it as a personal project to learn about websites and deployment. This also allowed more strict constraints on sign-ups, such as preventing multiple session bookings and non-Warwick students.\nThe name blackboards was chosen as this was initially a project to display members’ personal bests on a website, similar to how powerlifting gyms may have a physical blackboard that people can write their lifts on. The domain name blackboards.pl was also free, with .pl somewhat standing for ‘powerlifting’.\nInitial Usage For the first round of taster sessions, users could click on a session and enter their warwick.ac.uk email alongside their name. The system would then automatically send them an email with a confirmation link which they could click to fully register for the session. This ensured that only Warwick students could sign-up but required them to enter the same information every time they booked a session in later versions.\nDeployment Deployment was handled through Digital Ocean, as I had prior experience and enjoyed the simplistic usage. Being written in Rust, the compiled binary was also capable of handling several hundred requests per second even on the cheapest offering.\nOAuth1 Warwick provides an API for users to sign in with their Warwick account to other websites using OAuth1. Members of the club had previously complained that they needed to enter their information every time they registered for a session, so I began to explore other options. Allowing them to sign-in through Warwick’s single sign-on was easier for users, more secure and provided better consistency as I could work with their Warwick identifiers instead of names.\nAfter applying for a token to use on the domain blackboards.pl, I began experimenting with the system. As most major implementations now use OAuth2 and Warwick’s documentation was written at a higher level than Rust’s oauth1-request provided, this required a lot of trial and error. However, once it began working, users could automatically be authenticated when visiting the page and redirected back to the site where I could work with their user identifier instead. This meant that sessions could be booked through a simple button click and all pages could be aware of who was currently viewing them.\nContinuous Deployment blackboards itself was the main driver for another of my projects called fisherman. Every time changes were made to blackboards itself, someone would need to SSH into the server, pull the changes and wait for them to build before restarting the program with supervisorctl restart blackboards.\nEventually this became cumbersome, so fisherman was written to handle this process for me. It would listen for GitHub’s webhook messages and decide whether to pull or not before building a new binary and deploying it. This allowed for much faster development of features with them being automatically deployed to the production instance.\nElections Towards the end of second term, each society and club typically hold elections where members can vote on who they want in each executive position for the coming year. When held in person, this is done by paper balloting similar to general elections, however the ongoing pandemic made this not possible. Speeches were instead done through Microsoft Teams and we needed a way to ensure the election ran smoothly. Additionally, we wanted to hold Warwick Barbell’s first ranked choice voting election, something other clubs had found success with. For these reasons, I began working on extending Blackboards to support running an election.\n","wordCount":"668","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-03-13T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-03-13T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://alexander-jackson.github.io/projects/blackboards/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://alexander-jackson.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
