It takes a stream of incoming data tuples and inserts each into a specific cluster based on its distance to their centres. On each insertion, it can then output a cluster itself, with each tuple inside anonymised based on the contents.

This involved understanding academic content and ensuring it met the guarantees described, with heavy testing on large datasets and with malformed data.\nExtending CASTLE During the development of the algorithm, the team realised that we could additionally provide the guarantee of differential privacy for output tuples by using a method called Bernoulli sampling. Whenever a tuple was inserted to the container, we could randomly decide to ignore it. This would mean that some tuples would not be output and thus attackers would not know which ones had been input.\nAfter presenting our work to our supervisor and achieving a high mark, we went on to publish the improved algorithm at the IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing 2020 in Calgary, Canada.\nPublication The full published paper can be read here.\n","wordCount":"275","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://alexander-jackson.github.io/projects/castleguard/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://alexander-jackson.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">CASTLEGUARD: Anonymised Data Streams with Guaranteed Differential Privacy</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2020-03-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 18, 2020</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>CASTLEGUARD is an extension of the CASTLE algorithm and provides the same
